View an Enrollment Count
*************************

After you create a course, you can access the total number of people who are
enrolled in it. When you view an enrollment count, note the following

* In addition to learners, the enrollment count includes all course team
  members, including Admins and Staff. (To work with a course in Studio, the
  LMS, or Insights, you must be enrolled in that course.)

* Learners can unenroll from courses, and course Admins and Staff can
  unenroll learners when necessary.

  .. note:: The enrollment count displays the number of currently enrolled
    learners and course team members. It is not a historical count of
    everyone who has ever enrolled in the course.

The total number of current enrollees is shown as the sum of the number of
people who selected each of the certification tracks (verified, professional,
or honor) that are available for your course.

To view the enrollment count for a course, follow these steps.

#. View the live version of your course.

#. Select **Instructor**, and then select **Course Info** if necessary. 

  The **Enrollment Information** section of the page that opens shows the
  number of people who are currently enrolled in your course and in each of
  the certification tracks.
