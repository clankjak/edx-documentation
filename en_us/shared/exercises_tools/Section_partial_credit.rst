Awarding Partial Credit for a Problem
***************************************

You can configure the following problem types so that learners can receive
partial credit for a problem if they submit an answer that is partly correct.

* :ref:`Checkbox`
* :ref:`Dropdown`
* :ref:`Multiple Choice`
* :ref:`Numerical Input`
* :ref:`Text Input`

By awarding partial credit for problems, you can motivate learners who have
learned some of the course content and provide a score that accurately
demonstrates their progress.

See the pages for these problem types for more information on configuring
partial credit.

How Learners Receive Partial Credit
==========================================

Learners receive partial credit when submitting an answer in the LMS. In the
following example, the multiple choice problem has three correct answers. If
the learner selects all three, and no others, she receives the full 1 point.

In this case, the learner selected two of the three correct choices and
received partial credit.
