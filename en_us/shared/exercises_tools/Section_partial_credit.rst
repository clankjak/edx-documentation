Awarding Partial Credit for a Problem
***************************************

You can configure the following problem types so that learners can receive
partial credit for a problem if they submit an answer that is partly correct.

* :ref:`Checkbox`
* :ref:`Dropdown`
* :ref:`Multiple Choice`
* :ref:`Numerical Input`

By awarding partial credit for problems, you can motivate learners who have
mastered some of the course content and provide a score that accurately
demonstrates their progress.

For more information about configuring partial credit, see the topic for each
problem type.
